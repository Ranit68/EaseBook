# Flutter Hotel Booking (Scaffold)

This is a minimal-but-polished Flutter app scaffold for a hotel booking application with a modern UI.

## Features
- List of hotels (sample data)
- Hotel detail screen with images, rating, amenities
- Booking flow with local storage (SharedPreferences)
- Search and basic filters
- Clean, responsive UI using Provider and Google Fonts

## How to run
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open the folder in Android Studio.
3. Run `flutter pub get`.
4. If Android/iOS platform folders are missing, run `flutter create .` in the project root once.
5. Run the app on an emulator or device.
